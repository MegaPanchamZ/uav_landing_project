## System Architecture

### Neural Engine (`neural_engine.py`)

- **Purpose**: Semantic segmentation of camera frames
- **Model**: BiSeNetV2 (ONNX format for cross-platform compatibility)
- **Classes**:
  - `background` (Class 0)
  - `safe_flat_surface` (Class 1)
  - `unsafe_uneven_surface` (Class 2)
  - `low_obstacle` (Class 3)
  - `high_obstacle` (Class 4)

### Symbolic Engine (`symbolic_engine.py`)

- **Purpose**: Rule-based reasoning and decision making
- **Key Rules**:
  - Minimum area requirements
  - Obstacle clearance validation
  - Geometric shape analysis
  - Temporal stability tracking
  - Multi-criteria scoring

### Configuration (`config.py`)

All system parameters are centralized in the configuration file:

- Neural network settings
- Class definitions and mappings
- Rule parameters (clearances, thresholds)
- Temporal stability settings
- Scoring weights
- Visualization parameters

## Key Rules and Logic

### Geometric Validation

- **Minimum Area**: Zones must be at least 3000 pixels
- **Aspect Ratio**: Between 0.3 and 3.0 to avoid overly elongated zones
- **Solidity**: At least 0.6 to ensure zones are reasonably filled

### Spatial Safety

- **High Obstacle Clearance**: 30 pixels minimum
- **Low Obstacle Clearance**: 15 pixels minimum
- **Distance calculation**: Uses OpenCV's point-to-polygon distance

### Temporal Stability

- **Window Size**: Tracks last 15 frames
- **Confirmation Threshold**: Zone must be valid in at least 10 of the last 15 frames
- **Position-based Tracking**: Groups zones by discretized position and size

### Scoring System

Final score is weighted combination of:
- **Area Score** (40%): Larger zones preferred
- **Center Score** (30%): Zones closer to image center preferred
- **Shape Score** (20%): Well-formed shapes preferred
- **Clearance Score** (10%): Greater clearance from obstacles preferred

## Controls

While running the application, use these keyboard shortcuts:

- **'q'**: Quit the application
- **'s'**: Save the current frame as an image
- **'r'**: Reset temporal tracking
- **'p'**: Print current performance statistics

## Performance Optimization

### CPU Optimization

- Morphological operations are minimized
- Efficient contour analysis
- Vectorized numerical operations with NumPy

### GPU Acceleration (Future)

The system is designed to support TensorRT optimization:

```bash
# Convert ONNX to TensorRT engine (requires TensorRT installation)
trtexec --onnx=bisenetv2_uav.onnx \
        --saveEngine=bisenetv2_uav.engine \
        --fp16
```

Then update `config.py`:
```python
MODEL_PATH = "bisenetv2_uav.engine"
```

## Development and Testing

### Test Scenarios

The test video generator creates four scenarios:

1. **Mixed**: Varied terrain with moderate obstacles
2. **Urban**: Pavement-heavy with buildings and vehicles
3. **Rural**: Grass-heavy with trees and natural obstacles
4. **Challenging**: Dense obstacles with limited safe zones

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in `config.py`:

```python
DEBUG_MODE = True
SAVE_DEBUG_FRAMES = True
```

### Performance Monitoring

The system tracks:
- Neural network inference time and FPS
- Symbolic processing time and FPS
- Zone detection statistics
- Memory usage (planned)

## Model Training (Future Work)

To train your own BiSeNetV2 model:

1. Collect UAV footage from your specific use case
2. Annotate frames using tools like CVAT or Labelbox
3. Fine-tune BiSeNetV2 on your dataset
4. Export to ONNX format
5. Optionally convert to TensorRT for maximum performance

### Annotation Guidelines

- **Class 1 (safe_flat_surface)**: Short grass, pavement, dirt roads, landing pads
- **Class 2 (unsafe_uneven_surface)**: Tall grass, bushes, water, rocky terrain
- **Class 3 (low_obstacle)**: Curbs, small debris, low fences
- **Class 4 (high_obstacle)**: Trees, buildings, people, vehicles, tall structures

## Integration with Flight Controllers

The system outputs structured decision data that can be integrated with flight controllers:

```python
decision = {
    'status': 'TARGET_ACQUIRED',
    'zone': {
        'center': (x, y),  # Pixel coordinates
        'score': 0.85,     # Confidence score
        'area': 5000,      # Zone area in pixels
        # ... additional metadata
    }
}
```

### Coordinate Transformation

To convert pixel coordinates to real-world coordinates, implement:

```python
def pixel_to_world(pixel_coords, altitude, camera_fov, image_resolution):
    """Convert pixel coordinates to meter offsets from current position."""
    # Implementation depends on camera calibration and mounting
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No camera found**: Check camera permissions and connection
2. **Poor performance**: Verify OpenCV installation and consider GPU acceleration
3. **No valid zones detected**: Adjust rule parameters in `config.py`
4. **Model not found**: Ensure ONNX model file exists or use placeholder mode

### Performance Tuning

Adjust these parameters in `config.py`:
- `MIN_LANDING_AREA_PIXELS`: Reduce for smaller zones
- `*_CLEARANCE`: Reduce for tighter obstacle tolerance
- `TEMPORAL_CONFIRMATION_THRESHOLD`: Reduce for faster decisions

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code structure and documentation patterns
2. Add unit tests for new functionality
3. Update the configuration file for new parameters
4. Test with multiple scenarios using the test video generator
