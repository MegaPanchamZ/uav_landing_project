Semantic Drone Dataset Analysis for UAV Landing Detection
========================================================

Critical analysis of the Semantic Drone Dataset to evaluate its potential
for improving UAV landing detection training methodology.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bulentsiyah/semantic-drone-dataset/data
- 400 training images at 6000x4000 pixels (24MP)
- 24 semantic classes with rich detail
- Professional drone imagery at 5-30m altitude
